In this project, we aim to build a predictive model that will be helpful for the classification of trial outcomes (success or failure). This predictive model will be based on neural activity data from visual discrimination tasks performed by mice. The dataset consists of spike train recordings from neurons in the visual cortex along with trial stimuli conditions (left and right contrast levels). The study is structured into three parts: exploratory data analysis (EDA), data integration, and model development. We will test this on various machine learning models to determine which is the most efficient predictor of them all.
